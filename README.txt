Welcome to the Haunted House Simulator!

In this spooky Haunted House, you will encounter mysterious events like wandering ghosts, eerie sounds, and the ever-important bowl of Halloween candy that must be kept full!


In this program, you will manage a haunted house where:

Ghosts linger ominously until they are scared away... but be careful, they may return!
Candy Bowls must be kept stocked for eager trick-or-treaters. Do not let the candy supply run low!
Spooky Sounds echo through the halls, sending shivers down your spine with each “Boo!”

We will write automated tests to make sure the Haunted House behaves just as it should. Frightening but fun, with enough treats to keep every trick-or-treater happy. Enter if you dare! 🎃



--> Tests to Write
We need the following test cases for our HauntedHouse class:

Ghost Presence: Check that a ghost is present when the HauntedHouse is created.
Scare Ghost: Verify that calling scareAwayGhost removes the ghost.
Refill Candy Bowl: Ensure that refilling the candy bowl increases the count correctly.
Spooky Sound: Test that the spooky sound method returns "Boo!".
Negative Candy: Confirm that attempting to add a negative amount of candy does not decrease the candy count.
Trick-Treat: Calling trickOrTreat decreases the candy by the correct amount
TooManyPeople: Calling trickOrTreat with more people than available candy does not lead to a negative amount

--> Functionality to add and test
RunningLow: When the candyCount reaches Zero it should be replenished
Haunting: Bringing back the ghost so the house is haunted again
